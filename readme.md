# Contact Lens app
Web app to track contact lens usage. Work in progress

TODO:

- Single lens view
- Lens state edit
- Think about calculate time by subtracting 'now' from 'expire'
- Sanitize moment() usage, maybe create a multi-purpose function
- styling
- Change /view/lens.code uri by lens.id maybe?
