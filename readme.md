# Contact Lens app
Web app to track contact lens usage. Work in progress

TODO:

- Think about calculate time by subtracting 'now' from 'expire'
- Sanitize moment() usage, maybe create a multi-purpose function
- styling
- Default template validation. What happens if all templates are default: false? - fix this.
